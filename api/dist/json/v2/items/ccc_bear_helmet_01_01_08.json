  "Description": "Item Type: Flight Helmet\nDamage Reduction: 10%\n\nCelebrate Day of the Vara in sinister style with this officially licensed Fieldsbury Dark Bear helmet. This twisted version of the Fieldsbury Bear mascot launched a seasonal soda flavor before being co-opted into a series of high-profile pranks. Ever since, the bear's big, toothy grin and off-set flickering eyes have become a standard sight at Day of the Vara celebrations. Now CC's Conversions has designed and delivered an official, high quality reproduction of this iconic mascot, available in six striking colors.",
