  "Description": "Item Type: Medium Armor\nDamage Reduction: 30%\nTemp. Rating: -61 / 91 Â°C\n\nThe Paladin came out of Virgil's industrial division as a prototype helmet for salvage and repair operations. Yet its striking design so impressed company executives that they integrated it into their personal armor line. While the helmet's look stayed the same, Virgil reworked the design to use a combat rated, durable alloy for its distinct frame and reinforced the plating protecting the back of the head.",
