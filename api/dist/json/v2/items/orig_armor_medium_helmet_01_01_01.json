  "Description": "Item Type: Medium Armor\nDamage Reduction: 30%\nTemp. Rating: -61 / 91 Â°C \n\nInspired by the sleek stylings of the 100 series, the Giocoso is a helmet worthy of Origin Jumpworks. It features a wide face shield to provide excellent peripheral vision and a special internal air flow system to dissipate heat and humidity. In a nod to the 100 series, the back of the helmet slyly integrates the iconic shape language of the ship's tail into the form.",
